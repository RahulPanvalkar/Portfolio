## About

My personal portfolio, which features some of my github projects as well as my resume and technical skills.


## TL;DR

This project is inspired by the design in [Soumyajit4419's Portfolio](https://github.com/soumyajit4419/Portfolio), originally built using React, which I have adapted to Angular.
